# BTWifiModule
Frsky Bluetooth Emulator

This code is for use on a ESP Wroom 32, it emulates

Not functinaly yet, can read AT commands and Data from the Radio.

On the ideas list.. 
-----------------
- First and formost, get BT trainer working with the FrSky Para Module.. Then the CC2540 Module (if possible)
- Trainer over Wifi (longer range especially with 11b 1Mbps mode)
- Telemetry output but over Wifi
- Over the Air firmware updates
- Build the jumper board to have available for installation in the radio
